title: LiveIntent Audiences Destination
rewrite: true
beta: true
---

LiveIntent Audiences supports audiences generated by Segment Personas as a user property. To use this destination as intended, you will need to have Segment’s Business Tier plan which gives you access to [Personas][/docs/personas/].

If you don’t have access to Personas but still want to send data to LiveIntent, you can use the [Page][/docs/connections/spec/page], [Screen][/docs/connections/spec/screen/], [Track][/docs/connections/spec/track/], [Identify][/docs/connections/spec/identify/], and [Group][/docs/connections/spec/group/] calls. For more information about sending your data to LiveIntent via direct calls (to Page, Screen, Track, Identify, and Group), please reach out to your LiveIntent customer success representative.

This destination is maintained by LiveIntent. For any information about this destination, [contact the LiveIntent Support team](mailto:support@liveintent.com).
